          in the plant's <a href="/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature">binomial</a> name

          meaning "to sow", indicating that the seeds of the plant were sown in gardens. <i>Eruca sativa</i> differs from <i>E. vesicaria</i>

        <h2 id="Ecology"> Ecology </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Eruca vesicaria typically grows on dry, disturbed ground.
          It is a source of food for the larvae of some moth species, including the garden carpet,
          and its roots are susceptible to nematode infestation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Cultivation"> Cultivation and History </h2>
        <hr>
        <p> A pungent, leafy green vegetable resembling a longer-leaved and open lettuce,
           <i>Eruca vesicaria</i> is rich in <a href="/wiki/Vitamin_C" title="Vitamin C">
             vitamin C</a> and <a href="/wiki/Potassium" title="Potassium">potassium</a>.
             In addition to the leaves, the flowers, young seed pods and mature seeds are all edible.
        </p>
        <p>Grown as an edible and popular herb in Italy since Roman times, it was mentioned by various ancient
          Roman classical authors as an aphrodisiac,most famously in a poem long ascribed
          to the famous 1st century Roman poet Virgil, Moretum, which contains the line:
          "et Venerem revocans eruca morantem" ("and the rocket, which revives drowsy Venus [sexual desire]"),
          and in the Ars Amatoria of Ovid. Some writers assert that for this reason during the
          Middle Ages it was forbidden to grow rocket in monasteries. It was listed, however,
          in a decree by Charlemagne of 802 as one of the pot herbs suitable for growing in gardens.
          Gillian Riley, author of the Oxford Companion to Italian Food, states that because of its
          reputation as a sexual stimulant, it was "prudently mixed with lettuce, which was the opposite"
          (i.e., calming or even soporific). Riley continues that "nowadays rocket is enjoyed innocently
          in mixed salads, to which it adds a pleasing pungency", though Norman Douglas
          insisted that “Salad rocket is certainly a stimulant”.
        </p>
        <p>Rocket was traditionally collected in the wild or grown in home gardens along with such herbs as parsley and basil.
          It is now grown commercially in many places, and is available for purchase in
          supermarkets and farmers' markets throughout the world. It is also naturalized as a wild plant away from its native range in temperate regions around the world, including northern Europe and North America.[19][2] In India, the mature seeds are known as Gargeer. This is the same name in Arabic, جِرْجِير (jirjīr), but used in Arab countries for the fresh leaves.
        </p>
        <p>Mild frost conditions hinder the plant's growth and turn the green leaves red.

        <h2 id="Uses"> Uses </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Since Roman times in Italy, raw rocket has been added to salads.
        It is often added to a pizza at the end of or just after baking.
        It is also used cooked in Apulia, in southern Italy, to make the pasta dish cavatiéddi,
        "in which large amounts of coarsely chopped rocket are added to pasta seasoned with a
        homemade reduced tomato sauce and pecorino", as well as in "many unpretentious recipes in which it is added,
        chopped, to sauces and cooked dishes" or in a sauce (made by frying it in olive oil and garlic)
        used as a condiment for cold meats and fish. Throughout Italy it is used as a salad with tomatoes,
        and with either <a href="/wiki/Burrata" title="Burrata">burrata</a>, bocconcini, buffalo and mozzarella cheese.
        In Rome, rucola is used in straccetti, a dish of thin slices of beef with raw rocket and Parmesan cheese.
        </p>
        <p> In Turkey, similarly, the rocket is eaten raw as a side dish or salad with fish,
           but is additionally served with a sauce of extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice.
        </p>
        <p>In Slovenia, rocket is often combined with boiled potatoes or used in a soup. </p>
        <p>In West Asia, Pakistan and Northern India, Eruca seeds are pressed to make taramira oil,
          used in pickling and (after aging to remove acridity) as a salad or cooking oil.
           The seed cake is also used as animal feed.
        </p>
